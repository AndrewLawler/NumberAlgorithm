# Biggest Number & Smallest Number Program

I was sat in a lecture about algorithms and we went through two algorithms. One was to find the largest number in one loop and the other was to find the smallest. I was shocked when we then didnt combine the two and thats what i then set out to do. I drew the layout for the code in my book and then got to work implementing it when i got home. 

## How it works

It was fairly easy to make. I knew that all i needed was one variable called mini and one called maxi. I then needed to set up an array. I knew that if the first two numbers in the array were in order of smallest to biggest, it would allow me to set my variables.

What i mean by this is... You can find the largest and smallest number in any given array as long as the first two numbers are in the correct order. If they are, you simply check the others numbers against the two and change if needed.

## Usage

To try out this program simply follow the built-in menu and see how it works for yourself.
